Files that should be in this directory:
	-main.c
	-oss.c
	-user.c
	-info.h
	-Makefile
	-hidden .git directory
	-this README

Getting started: Type the command: make proj3
	Files should compile and you should be left with 3 executables in the directory: proj3, oss, and user.

Running proj3: please type the options in the order you see here: ./proj3 -s x -t z -l filename
	I ran into some trouble getting the optarg to work with global variables and forked items so the argvs are hardcoded in array positions

Things not implemented in this project:
	-Logging
	-Shared memory message queue
	-Starting more processes on after other children have finished executing
	-Timeout on alarm/signal handling to clean up memory
